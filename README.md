# Question-2-Review

Given an array A[], Length of array(A[]) N, An integer K

Question : Given an array find the sum of length of sub arrays that are contiguous and non overlapping and their elements 
are less than or equal to a given integer K

TestClass.java contains solution to this problem.

Example : 

N = 5 , K =4

A[] = {4,8,5,2,4}

Output = 3
as subarrays that are contiguous and non overlapping and have elements less than or equal to 4 are :

{4} --> length= 1 , {2,4} --> length =2  so, (1+2)
